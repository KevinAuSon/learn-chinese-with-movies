# useful_chinese
Project aiming to find the best available resources on the web for a user to enable him to improve his chinese

This is a project I want to work on when I will have time to do so.
If you have some ideas to improve it or other random features, please create an issue!

Alright! Load of ressources like movies / musics / texts are out there, available to improve our chinese.
Alas, especially as a beginner, it's hard to find the ones which would help you the most with an optimal ratio of new vocabulary/known vocabulary.

This is what I would like to solve here. The idea: you give a website a list of word you know (anki, plain text...), or of resosurces
you used and which was optimal (movies...) and a list of resources would be given to you to help you consolidate or discover 
new words.
If you have an objective, like to watch a specific movie, it will give you the minimal set of resources which would cover the
vocabulary you need to appreciate it.

Ciao
